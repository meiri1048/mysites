                        Hi. My name is Akari Omiya. I am a 4th grade 1st semester student of International Relationship faculty at Ritsumeikan University. 
                        Graduation year would be 2021 or 2022 and it is depends on how my application for absence from the school goes.
                        I was really impressed by possibilities of IT when I first visit Sillicon Valley, although I have never even touched with programing and cording.  
                        I am currently put my effort in studying and developing my skills of programing.
                        I think encounters with people, learns from outside of school and my various hobby offers me unique and precious ideas and learns besides things we learn in the school. 
                        My ultimate goal are making values based on my experiences to contribute the society and exerting senses of myself.

                        People I met beyond borders and nationalities thought my hobbies gave me the ways of “thinking outside of the box”. 
                        During weekends and long vacations are the times I say bye to workplaces and study room and spending times with people and my hobbies. 
                        Because I have hobbies, I am who I am.
